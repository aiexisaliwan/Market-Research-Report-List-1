<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Heat Sterilization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flame Sterilization</li><li>Hot Air Sterilization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry heat sterilization market comprises two primary types: flame sterilization and hot air sterilization. Flame sterilization utilizes an open flame to incinerate microorganisms on instruments, providing rapid sterilization suitable for small items like loops and needles. In contrast, hot air sterilization employs a controlled high-temperature environment, typically between 160°C to 180°C, for an extended duration to effectively sterilize larger equipment and materials. Both methods ensure the elimination of pathogens without moisture, making them ideal for heat-resistant items.</p></p>
