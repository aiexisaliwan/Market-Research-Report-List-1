<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LTE Pico Base Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time Division Duplex (TDD)</li><li>Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the LTE Pico Base Station market, there are two main duplexing types: Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). TDD uses a single frequency to transmit and receive data, allocating time slots for uplink and downlink transmissions, making it flexible for varying traffic demands. In contrast, FDD employs separate frequencies for uplink and downlink, providing consistent data flow and low latency. Both types serve different deployment needs, impacting coverage and capacity in dense urban environments.</p></p>
