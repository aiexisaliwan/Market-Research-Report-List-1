<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD System</li><li>Dry & Semi-dry FGD System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) system market is primarily segmented into three types: Wet FGD systems, Dry FGD systems, and Semi-dry FGD systems. Wet FGD systems utilize a liquid absorbent, usually limestone, to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas, making it effective for large-scale power plants. Dry FGD systems use dry sorbents, which are more cost-effective and easier to maintain. Semi-dry systems combine aspects of both, using a spray dryer absorber to manage moisture levels while efficiently capturing sulfur emissions.</p></p>
